## Overview

**An AI-Powered No-Code Development Framework** that takes you from **Idea ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Test** without writing a single line of code.

Anvil provides a clean, organized interface for defining product specifications that automatically transform into working software through AI-powered development workflows.

Anvil is not just a PRD management tool - it's a complete product development pipeline that transforms ideas into working software. Define your product requirements using structured capabilities and enablers, then watch as AI automatically generates your entire application with comprehensive testing through seamless integration with Claude Code and other AI development tools.

**Complete Development Pipeline:**
- üí° **Idea**: Capture and organize product concepts
- üìã **Requirements**: Structure capabilities, enablers, and detailed specifications
- üé® **Design**: Automated system architecture and component design
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Code**: AI-generated implementation with full functionality
- üß™ **Test**: Automated test generation and validation
- üöÄ **Deploy**: Ready-to-run applications from your specifications

### Philosophy & Focus

Anvil is specifically designed for the **right side of the engineering problem** - the **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** that form the architectural foundation of software systems.

Product development has two distinct sides:
- **Left Side (Creative Design Space)**: Experiences and Features - the domain of Product Managers and UX designers
- **Right Side (Technical Implementation)**: Technical Capabilities and Enablers - the domain of Engineers and Architects

Anvil focuses exclusively on the right side, helping engineering teams define, organize, and manage the technical capabilities that enable product experiences. A new platform is coming soon for the left side that will marry **Experiences and Features** (Product Managers) with **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** (Engineers) to build the architectural runway needed to support exceptional user experiences.

- **Enablers** are technical implementations that realize capabilities through specific functionality
- **Requirements** define specific functional and non-functional needs within enablers

#### Quality and Governance
- All development follows strict approval workflows
- Pre-condition verification prevents bypassing of quality gates
- State-based progression ensures proper task sequencing

#### Documentation-First Approach
- Specifications are created before implementation
- Technical diagrams and designs guide development
- All artifacts are version controlled and traceable

   ```

   **For Reverse Engineering Existing Applications:**
   ```
   Claude, I have an existing application that I want to reverse engineer and add new capabilities to. Please analyze the codebase, create capability and enabler specifications, and then suggest new capabilities I can add.
   ```

   **For Implementation (After Discovery Complete):**
   ```
   Claude, please read the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md in the specifications folder and develop the application specified in the specifications folder.
   ```
