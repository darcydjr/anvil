## Overview

**An AI-Powered No-Code Development Framework** that takes you from **Idea ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Test** without writing a single line of code.

Anvil provides a clean, organized interface for defining product specifications that automatically transform into working software through AI-powered development workflows.

Anvil is not just a PRD management tool - it's a complete product development pipeline that transforms ideas into working software. Define your product requirements using structured capabilities and enablers, then watch as AI automatically generates your entire application with comprehensive testing through seamless integration with Claude Code and other AI development tools.

**Complete Development Pipeline:**
- üí° **Idea**: Capture and organize product concepts
- üìã **Requirements**: Structure capabilities, enablers, and detailed specifications
- üé® **Design**: Automated system architecture and component design
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Code**: AI-generated implementation with full functionality
- üß™ **Test**: Automated test generation and validation
- üöÄ **Deploy**: Ready-to-run applications from your specifications

### Philosophy & Focus

Anvil is specifically designed for the **right side of the engineering problem** - the **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** that form the architectural foundation of software systems.

Product development has two distinct sides:
- **Left Side (Creative Design Space)**: Experiences and Features - the domain of Product Managers and UX designers
- **Right Side (Technical Implementation)**: Technical Capabilities and Enablers - the domain of Engineers and Architects

Anvil focuses exclusively on the right side, helping engineering teams define, organize, and manage the technical capabilities that enable product experiences. A new platform is coming soon for the left side that will marry **Experiences and Features** (Product Managers) with **Technical Capabilities and Enablers** (Engineers) to build the architectural runway needed to support exceptional user experiences.

### Core Principles

#### Components-Capabilities-Enablers-Requirements Model
- **Components** are logical software systems or applications that contain capabilities
- **Capabilities** represent high-level business functions within components that deliver value to users
- **Enablers** are technical implementations that realize capabilities through specific functionality
- **Requirements** define specific functional and non-functional needs within enablers

#### Quality and Governance
- All development follows strict approval workflows
- Pre-condition verification prevents bypassing of quality gates
- State-based progression ensures proper task sequencing

#### Documentation-First Approach
- Specifications are created before implementation
- Technical diagrams and designs guide development
- All artifacts are version controlled and traceable

## Quick Start

### Launch Anvil

**Windows:**
```bash
start-anvil.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x start-anvil.sh
./start-anvil.sh
```

**Manual Start:**
```bash
npm install  # First time only
npm start    # Start the server
```

The start scripts will:
- Automatically install dependencies if needed
- Start the Anvil server
- Open at http://localhost:3000

### Launch Claude Code for Implementation

Once you have your specifications ready in Anvil:

1. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
   (This should be the parent folder that contains your `specifications/` folder with capabilities and enablers)

2. **Launch Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

3. **Implementation Commands**:

   **For Discovery (Documentation Only):**
   ```
   Claude, please read the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md and perform DISCOVERY ONLY on this project. Create specifications documentation but DO NOT implement anything.
   ```

   **For Implementation (After Discovery Complete):**
   ```
   Claude, please read the SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md and develop the application specified in the specifications folder.
   ```

## Implementation Workflow

Anvil is designed to work seamlessly with Claude Code for automated development implementation:

### Step 1: Product Definition in Anvil
1. **Create Capabilities**: Define high-level system capabilities using Anvil's capability forms
2. **Add Enablers**: Break down capabilities into detailed enablers with requirements
3. **Set Status Fields**: Configure Analysis Review and Design Review requirements for each document
4. **Development Plans**: Ensure each enabler includes a comprehensive Development Plan section

### Step 2: Automated Development Sequence
Claude Code will automatically:

1. **üìã Analysis Phase** (if Analysis Review = "Required"):
   - Read all capability and enabler specifications
   - Analyze requirements and dependencies
   - Generate technical analysis documentation
   - Update Status: "Ready for Analysis" ‚Üí "In Analysis" ‚Üí "Ready for Design"

2. **üé® Design Phase** (if Design Review = "Required"):
   - Create system architecture designs
   - Design component interfaces and APIs
   - Generate design documentation
   - Update Status: "Ready for Design" ‚Üí "In Design" ‚Üí "Ready for Implementation"

3. **‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Phase**:
   - Generate code following development plans
   - Implement functional and non-functional requirements
   - Create tests and documentation
   - Update Status: "Ready for Implementation" ‚Üí "In Implementation" ‚Üí "Implemented"

4. **üîÑ Status Synchronization**:
   - Automatically update Anvil document statuses
   - Sync requirement completion states
   - Trigger automated workflow transitions

### Implementation Tips
- **Detailed Development Plans**: Include specific implementation steps, file structures, and dependencies
- **Clear Requirements**: Use Functional and Non-Functional requirement tables with priorities
- **Status Configuration**: Set Analysis Review and Design Review to "Required" for comprehensive implementation
- **Directory Structure**: Organize specifications in logical system/component folders for Claude to navigate
- **Regular Sync**: Refresh Anvil after implementation phases to see updated statuses
